This extension is actually a fork of shatypes[1] which adds some other data types
as crc32 and provides some fixes to original implementations.

This project is a continuation of the project formerly at https://github.com/infofarmer/hashtypes.
Many thanks to Andrey Ropp, Infofarmer, and others for their work and support on the transition.[2]
